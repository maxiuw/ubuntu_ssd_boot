# Assumptions:
# - /boot is not on a separate partition.
# - root partition has label $UbuntuLabel and the first partition on the same device is the EFI system partition,
# - root partition backup has label $UbuntuBackupLabel and the first partition on the same device is available for the EFI system partition backup,
# - device names are like sd[a-z].

# To do:
# - pick and exclude duplicate mount (e. g. for NFS) from /etc/fstab to avoid overfilling the backup device,
# -check that backup volume partition sizes are enough.
